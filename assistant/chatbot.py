# Chatbot Module
# =======================================================================
# This module contains all the logic for:
# - Matching user input to predefined intents
# - Handling typos with fuzzy matching
# - Detecting dictionary queries (like "define umbrella")
# - Detecting calculator queries and to-do commands
# - Returning appropriate bot responses
# =======================================================================

import random  # Used to randomly select a reply from a list of responses
import re      # Used to define regex patterns and search text
from difflib import get_close_matches  # Used for typo-tolerance (e.g., "helo" -> "hello")

# Import dictionary, calculator and todo features from assistant/features package.
# These are functions that live in other files and are re-used here.

from assistant.features.calculator import evaluate
from assistant.features.todo import add_task, get_tasks, remove_task, mark_done


# =======================================================================
# INTENTS (patterns + responses)
# =======================================================================
# Intents are like categories of conversation.
# Each intent has:
#   - "patterns": example user phrases we want to recognize
#   - "responses": replies the assistant will randomly pick from
# NOTE: We keep this data-driven so the matching logic below is generic.
